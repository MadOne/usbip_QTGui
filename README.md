# usbip_QTGui  

This is my version of an USB/IP gui.
Is ~~heavyly inspired~~ copied from <https://github.com/K-Francis-H/usbip-gui>.

## Dependencies

QT
(polkit)

## Features

Aditionally a Server Manager was implemented.

## My thougts on this project

The goal of this application is for me to learn programming.
This is my first application.

If you are missing features, feel free to request them. But as i am new to programming, this might either take a long time or be to complicated for me.

This application is completely open source. You can do whatever you want with it.

I know lots of you can do this much better then my but i would really like to keep this project in my hands so i can learn.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute to this project. But be prepared for me to ask ~~dumb~~ beginner Questions. Beginners are also welcome.

## ToDo

- ~~Pick license~~
- Multiple IPs as remote
- Polkit integration
- Check if kernel modules ar loaded
- Loading kernel modules on start
- Assist in autoloading kernel module
- Create polkit file for usbip
- Lots of errorhandling
